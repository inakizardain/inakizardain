### Welcome to my portfolio 

### Allow me to introduce myself briefly 🧑

I am an economist from Mexico who studied at "El Colegio de México" and at the "Higher School of Economics" in Moscow. In these institutions I learned and leveraged my econometrical, statistical and programming skills, but most importantly, I developed an interest for research and investigation related to many topics focused on industries and political issues with the hope that I will produce a possitive impact for at least one person with my work. 🏛
